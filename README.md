# BookHotel — React Full Stack Hotel Booking Platform

BookHotel is a modern full-stack hotel booking application built with **React**, designed as part of my ongoing full-stack development progression.  
This project focuses on clean architecture, reusable components, modular folder structure, API integration, state management, and scalable front-end development practices.
